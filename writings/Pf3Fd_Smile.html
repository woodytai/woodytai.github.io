        <h2 alt="Title">Grief behind a smile</h2>
        <p class="articlecentered" alt="Title">Grief behind a smile</p>
        <p><q>Boys don't cry</q> It might be sexist but growing up in Hong Kong meant that I was in a society where
          stoicism is part of the culture. My parents and so many before them were always told that showing
          vulnerability was a weakness. My parents tried to distance me from that mentality, but with relatives and
          friends, it became hard. </p>

        <p>I was complimented by my teachers <small>(at least according to my mom)</small> because of how I'd always
          smile, which growing up, slowly developed into this image that no matter the challenge I faced, whenever there
          were difficulties whether from academic strides to adolescence dreams — I needed to smile through it all. </p>

        <p>This slowly morphed into <q>If I smiled, no one would pry or ask!</q> because deep down I knew that if
          someone looked me in the eye and asked <q>Are you ok?</q> I'd break down on the spot. This facade became my
          shield, protecting me from the discomfort of other's potential reactions. </p>

        <br>
        <blockquote>I worried that if I revealed even an ounce of sadness, I might lose all the potential in other's
          eyes that I so dearly want. <small>After all who wants to be seen as needy and moody, right?</small>
        </blockquote><br>

        <p>As I navigated my confused teenage years, this seemed to finally set in and almost forced me to conform to
          this society's 'norm' to fit in. The more I looked at my peers who seemed to handle hurdles easily, the more I
          buried my emotions. </p>

        <p>Now onto a bit of a psych lesson, you can't choose to only feel some emotions, it was mostly black and white,
          meaning, You can't just bury sadness, you have to bury every emotion on the face of this earth, which thinking
          back was really toxic. </p>
        <blockquote>□</blockquote>
        <p>Yet I still buried my emotions like it was every Tuesday, the more they built up. Like a dam with the water
          level rising by the day, eventually leading to the uncontrolled release of impounded emotions, rushing over my
          body like ants crawling all over, everything seemed to spin and my heart went into overdrive. As every single
          emotion I've repressed floods out, a melting pot of insecurities and emotions washes over me, but not as
          gentle waves but rather as a tsunami with hundreds of feet worth of water overwhelming every sense of my body,
          my palace I so dearly fought for, where every single insecurity is amplified and examined. </p>
        <blockquote>□</blockquote>
        <p>After 2 years of living as if I was on a roller-coaster, thinking <q>Thank god, they didn't realise how
            stressed I was</q> or <q>Phew, thank god they didn't ask about me!</q> and the next moment judging myself as
          if I was a saint and demanded perfection, looking over every flaw and mistake I have. </p>

        <p>Now I take a different approach, I still have the dam sitting there, just not releasing it when it inevitably
          breaks, but rather when I have a moment to wind down and take a peek into who I really am. </p>
