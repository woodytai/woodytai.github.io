        <p>Last semester we were in the same form group, we both hung out but we were overworked and had some unresolved
          conflicts, so we took a small break, what we both didn't realise was that the break was <i>a year</i> too
          long. </p>
        <p>Moreover, as the new semester commenced, our form groups were once more rearranged. Just when I thought our
          relationship began to warm, This girl that neither of us was close with, wanted to play matchmaker and decided
          to ship us together, which made our relationship sour once again, I tried to find you only to be met with
          hostility, I tried to move on but everything hurts, our lives were way too over twined at that point, I
          couldn't bear to lose you, I messaged you over the month, only to have an annoyed response flash across your
          face.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, we talked for the first time in over a month. Your eyes were tired from working alone, your soul
          agape. I could see your sorrow hidden behind that Boy Scout face. Hell, that could just be my delusions.</p>
        <p>So, here I am, and there you are, finding me today. We chatted, not about the mess of insecurities brewing
          inside, but about work. It bugs me, you know? I've got a million things I want to say, but they all stay stuck
          in my head. All I could do was look into your eyes, feeling more hurt than ever, yet you seemed to miss it
          all.</p>
        <p class="articlecentered"><q>Cursed are those who feel oceans but can only express a drop. </q></p>
        <p>Then, in the rush between classes, you threw out the idea of us running for head boy together. My eyes lit up
          with hope, thinking, "Is this real?" You caught that glimmer, but I wonder if you sensed the mix of
          embarrassment and sadness I am so used to hiding behind my smile. Now, I'm torn. Should I be mad or glad that
          you're reaching out to me like this?</p>
        <blockquote>‚ñ°</blockquote>
        <p>As we discussed the mundane, I felt a storm of conflicting emotions brewing within me, a tempest of gratitude
          and longing tangled with uncertainty and unspoken desires. Your proposal to run for head boy together ignited
          a spark in my soul, a flicker of hope amidst the shadows of doubt.</p>
        <p>As our eyes met and held, a silent dialogue unfolded between us, left with unspoken truths and the weight of
          our shared history. I stood there, a mosaic of memories flashing before my eyes, bound moments and emotions
          left unspoken. </p>
        <h3>To draw this narrative to a close, I offer a brief Chinese proverb that encapsulates the essence of my
          diary: "Âõ†ÁÇ∫Ëá™Â∑±Ê∑ãÈÅéÈõ®ÔºåÊâÄ‰ª•ÊÉ≥ÁÇ∫‰ªñ‰∫∫ÊíêÊääÂÇò" ‚Äî a testament to the desire to shield others from the storms we have weathered.
