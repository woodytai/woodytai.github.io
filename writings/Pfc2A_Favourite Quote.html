        <h1 alt="Title">Favourite Quote — We are all growing up</h1>
        <p class="articlecentered" alt="Title">What is failure?</p>
        <blockquote><em><q>Insert another generic quote about not giving up</q></em></blockquote>
        <p>When I grew up, I always thought it was a load of crap—who cares? When society defines "success" as the end
          goal, are we truly punished for making mistakes? Does not giving up matter?</p>

        <p>Before you roll your eyes at me, I don't want to tell you a sad story about how I struggled or resort to
          another common essay trope. Instead, I hope you will momentarily step into my shoes and view things from my
          perspective. </p>

        <p>My extracurriculars are pretty nice if I do say so myself, but when I was 15, I didn't realise that I would
          make a decision that would change my worldview. It wasn't to cure cancer or end world hunger, but it was 2
          clicks on my laptop, just a mere two clicks. <br>I decided to open a folder on my Desktop. </p>

        <p>What did this folder contain? Every acceptance and rejection email meticulously saved. It took me six
          grueling hours to sort through my emails. Each email with served as a stark reminder of the things I once took
          for granted — things that had become almost expected or insignificant. But to think less than a decade ago, I
          would have nearly cried at the opportunity. </p>
        <p>Looking back, I couldn’t be more grateful for the rejections. Without them, I would’ve escaped this
          inferiority complex of not pursuing or being in something prestigious. </p>
        <blockquote>□</blockquote>

        <p>As I sat there, staring at my screen filled with those acceptance and rejection emails, it hit me like a ton
          of bricks. These weren't just any email — they were like markers in some of the key chapters of my life. </p>

        <p>That now-filled folder contained more than just emails; it was a reflection of my ambitions, a mirror of my
          efforts, and a glimpse into the rollercoaster of my emotions. Going through each of those emails was like
          going back in time, a flashback to the paths I failed, the challenges I lept over, Each click was a step back
          in time, as if I was reading pages of a memoir that I never knew existed. </p>

        <p>In those moments of nostalgia, the weight of those emails lay not in their text but in the emotions they
          stirred within me — pride, disappointment, hope, and a stubborn kind of determination — all mixed in a melting
          pot that made me — me. </p>

        <p>When I closed that folder, I did not merely go back in history; rather, I relived some of the happiest and
          most destitute parts of my life, but this time I felt a warm stream of tears landing on my lip, the feeling
          was almost soothing, as if I knew exalted the beauty of the process, and found solace in MY life's diverse
          experiences. </p>

        <p>What it made me realise was that,</p>
        <blockquote><em><q>Comparison was the actual thief of joy</q></em></blockquote>
