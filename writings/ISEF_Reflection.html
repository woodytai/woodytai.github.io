        <p class="articlecentered">Background</p>
        <div class="Generic-Header-Main">
          <div class="Generic-Header-Sub">
            <p>I want to share something really special to me. Like most STEM kids in the world, it has always been a
              dream of mine to be a finalist in the world's largest and most prestigious science competition.the worlds
              most prestigious science competition, the Regeneron International Science and Engineering fair. It was
              truly one of the best experiences of my life, and Iâ€™m so grateful to experience this in my teen years.
              <br><br>Reflecting on this, I feel a need to go back, not a week; not a month; But back when I was just in
              eighth grade. I wrote myself a little note:
            <blockquote>Just remember, 5 years ago, you dreamed of where you are NOW</blockquote>,I wrote this note
            because I felt lost, I saw my fellow students just 1 grade above me, doing research in Leukemia and so much
            more, and there I was with my 1<sup>st</sup> research project â€” How effective does sea water degrade
            plastic. I couldn't believe that in just 1 year, how I could see myself creating a Regional Science Fair
            worthy project, let alone an ISEF level project. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="Generic-Header-Sub" style="padding: 0 5% 0 5%;"><img
              src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHTn7A57RsdkA/feedshare-shrink_800/B56Zbbmr4eHUAk-/0/1747441081691?e=1750896000&v=beta&t=YHkoBuYkMS2jtoSfr_0yr6LjOtwsPbm33NWhPLsyy6M"

          </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Looking back at my week at ISEF, from the initial project set-up to the judging and finally the student
          mixer, it showcases how every student in that room was passionate about science. Even before arriving at
          Columbus, at the Hong Kong Regional Science Fairs, seeing all the students there being so passionate about
          their projects made me feel <i>off</i>.</p>
        <p>At the innovation panels and category sponsor event, we heard industry leaders and scientists speak
          passionately about their work and what all of them talked on and on about was this â€” the idea that we are not
          here to inherit the future but to create and save it.</p>

        <p class="articlecentered">
        <blockquote>Create the future</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>When I was setting up my project, I felt like I didn't belong in this pool of talent; I felt inferior, and to
          be completely honest, I felt like a fraud. All the finalists with their bright smiles and about to present
          graduate-level projects. I saw projects that would revolutionise their respective field and so much more, and
          there was I, my project was burning pee into energy(I used wastewater to generate hydrogen as an energy
          storage option)</p>
        <p>1,600 students, all working towards some goal, during the student mixer, something clicked in my head, I'm
          now in a room of potential future Nobel Laureates but at that moment, we were all just a bunch of people who
          were trying to make the most out of their moment and have some fun. I asked a fellow finalist <sub>who is
            smart btw :></sub>, "How are you still having so much fun with the competition just around the corner?"</p>
        <blockquote>Work Hard, Play Hard</blockquote>
        <p>That's when it clicked with me, all of these high-achieving students didn't make their entire personality or
          life around just science, they are just like any other teenager, trying to do what they can to have the best
          time in our very short week. But one thing stood out â€” we're all on this journey together, supporting one
          another. Regardless of whether we get any awards. The people I met at ISEF were similar yet different from me,
          I saw another finalist ready to embark on Pre-Med and Chemical Engineering. </p>
        <p>Last week, our goal was to solve a problem. We all can change the world, but so does everyone els. What
          separates me and ISEF winners is the limit that we are going to push ourselves to reach our definition of
          success. So I can practically guarantee you, as the kid that made it to ISEF not because of luck but
          dedication, anyone can change the world, you don't need to cure cancer, but start with your community. </p>
        <h3>I wanna end with the same quote that President and CEO of Society for Science and Executive Publisher of
          Science News â€” Maya Ajmera: <q style="font-weight: bold;">You have met YOUR people</q> </h3>
        <h2 class="articlecentered">STAY CURIOUS</h2>

        <hr>
        <p>If I were to offer one piece of advice to any future contestants, question everything, because when you dig
          deeper, those very moments of curiosity can spark something amazing in your journey</p>
