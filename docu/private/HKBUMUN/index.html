                <h3>Syrian Political Transition (December 2024)</h3>
                <p>In December 2024, a significant political transition took place in Syria after the Assad regime fell following 24 years of rule. This historic change included:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>The United States has cautiously welcomed these developments while emphasizing the need for inclusive governance, accountability for past abuses, and continued international support for the transition process.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="update-box">

Additionally, the United States of America has welcomed over 50,000 Syrian refugees in the past 13 years.</p>

            <h3>Position on the Assad Regime</h3>

                <li>Sustainable peace and stability</li>
                <li>International reconstruction aid</li>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The United States of America maintains a limited military presence in Syria for three primary purposes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Counterterrorism operations:</strong> To prevent the resurgence of ISIS and combat other terrorist organizations that threaten regional stability and United States of America national security.</li>
                            <li><strong>Support for local partners:</strong> To provide training, advice, and assistance to vetted local partners who are working to stabilize liberated areas and prevent terrorist control.</li>
                            <li><strong>Strategic leverage:</strong> To maintain influence in the diplomatic process and counter malign activities by Iran, Russia, and terrorist groups that would further destabilize the region.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The United States of America presence is not intended as an indefinite occupation but is conditions-based on achieving lasting defeat of ISIS and progress toward a political solution.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Why does the United States of America oppose reconstruction aid without political transition?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The United States of America opposes large-scale reconstruction aid to regime-controlled areas absent a credible political process for several reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Providing reconstruction aid without conditions would reward and legitimize the Assad regime's brutality against its own citizens.</li>
                            <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Reconstruction under corrupt regime institutions would likely fail to address the root causes of the conflict or benefit those most in need.</li>
                            <li><strong>Incentive structure:</strong> Unconditional aid would remove incentives for the regime to engage meaningfully in the political process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Regional stability:</strong> Strengthening Assad without political reform could fuel extremism and renewed conflict.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The United States of America does support targeted early recovery assistance that directly benefits Syrian civilians in all areas of Syria, provided it does not strengthen the Assad regime's grip on power.</p>

                        <p>The United States of America position on Syrian refugees encompasses several dimensions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Humanitarian support:</strong> Providing substantial funding to support refugees in neighboring countries and internally displaced persons within Syria.</li>
                            <li><strong>Refugee returns:</strong> Supporting the principle that refugee returns must be safe, voluntary, and dignified, with monitoring by relevant UN agencies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Root causes:</strong> Advocating that sustainable returns require a credible political solution, improved security conditions, and protection of returnees' rights, including housing, land, and property rights.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resettlement:</strong> The United States of America has committed to increase Syrian refugee resettlement as part of its broader refugee admissions program.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The United States of America opposes forced returns or demographic engineering that could further destabilize Syria or violate refugee rights under international law.</p>

                        <p>The United States of America approach to Russia on Syria combines principled opposition to harmful Russian actions with pragmatic engagement where interests may align:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Clear opposition:</strong> The United States of America condemns Russia's military support for the Assad regime, including targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shared interests:</strong> Where possible, the United States of America seeks to work with Russia on counterterrorism goals and supporting the UN-led political process.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The United States of America believes that Russia's long-term interests in Syria would be better served by supporting a stable political settlement rather than enabling an isolated and globally sanctioned Assad regime that cannot provide stability or attract reconstruction investment.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">What is the United States of America doing to address the humanitarian crisis in Syria?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The United States is a leading donor of humanitarian assistance to Syria, having contributed over $15 billion since the start of the crisis. The United States of America approach includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Direct aid:</strong> Funding for emergency food, shelter, health care, water, sanitation, and other critical services for vulnerable populations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diplomatic advocacy:</strong> Leading efforts in the UN Security Council to maintain cross-border humanitarian access mechanisms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sanctions exemptions:</strong> Ensuring that United States of America sanctions include robust humanitarian exemptions and general licenses to facilitate aid delivery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Early recovery support:</strong> Funding for essential services, livelihoods, and basic infrastructure in accessible areas.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Supporting documentation of humanitarian access restrictions and human rights violations that exacerbate the crisis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The United States of America has committed $457.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria in 2024 alone, and continues to urge all parties to allow unfettered humanitarian access to all populations in need.</p>
